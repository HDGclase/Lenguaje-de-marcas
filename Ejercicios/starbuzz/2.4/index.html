<h1>Starbuzz Coffea Beverages</h1>

<h2>House Blend, $1.49</h2>

<p>It’s deceptively simple. A blend of fine Latin American beans roasted to a glistening, dark chestnut color.
 Loaded with flavor, balancing tastes of nut and cocoa, just a touch of sweetness from the roast.</p>

<h2>Mocha Cafe Latte, $2.35</h2>

Any one of the above espresso + milk drinks with chocolate added.

<h2>Cappuccino, $1.89</h2>

<p>A mixture espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. 
The milk is steamed through a special high pressure steam pipe on the espresso machine.</p>

<h1>Chai Tea, $1.85</h1>

A spicy drink made with black tea, spices, milk and honey.
